This project will create a webpage designed to assist CS students in managing their classes. The Program will allow users to input the grades that they recieve or anticipate recieving into the program and check to see if they will meet the requirements of future classes and the effect such grades would do to their overall GPA. This program will list the required class for CS students the names of the classes and a description of the class.

We are currently in the build phase of the project and are constructing a working version with the features listed in the SRS document.
